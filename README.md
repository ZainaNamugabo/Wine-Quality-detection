# Wine-Quality-detection
This project explores machine learning techniques to predict the quality rating of wines based on their physicochemical properties. Models were trained to evaluate sensory quality on a numeric scale, supporting applications in quality control, recommendation engines, and consumer analytics.

Key Features
- Multimodel Comparison: Evaluates classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and KNN classifier.
- Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and correlation analysis to improve learning outcomes.
- Performance Metrics: Assessed with accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- Feature Importance & Visualization: Highlights top predictors such as alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates, with clear charts using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

This project demonstrates practical skill in model benchmarking and interpretability, blending analytical rigor with visual storytelling. Cheers to data science thatâ€™s both powerful and palatable.
